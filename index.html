    <p align="justify" style="color:black"> In secondary school, I was part of a team that participated in an app making in DKIT. The app that we worked on for the few weeks duration was a health and fitness app. This app worked sufficently just like any other app on mobile devices. This was challenging but thoroughly enjoyable at the same time. It gave me my first taste of what life in the technical world felt like.  </p>

     <h3 style="color:blue" font size="5"; align="justify"><i>PEER PRESSURE TEACHING</i></h3>
     <p align="justify"style="color:black">In my first PLC before commencing in NUIM, I took part in teaching a programme about peer pressure to young kids in my old secondary school.Here they learned about the affects of alcohol and drug abuse. <br>We conducted tasks through every class and they also enetered into a competition for the best poster illustrating the effects of alcohol and drugs can do to the body and also to say no. This was a great experience to actual teach these young kids about an important convept in which to never feel peer pressured into doing harmful things due to their surroundings or company.
